# MERingue

`MERingue` enables spatial gene expression analysis in non-homogenous tissues. The overall approach is detailed in the following publication: **COMING SOON**

## Benefits and Capabilities

(1) Identify and characterize spatially clustered genes

(2) Identify and visualize spatial patterns

(3) Test for spatial interactions using spatial cross-correlation analysis

(4) Group cells based on spatial relationships

(5) Background error modeling

## Installation

To install `MERingue`, we recommend using `devtools`:
```
require(devtools)
devtools::install_github('JEFworks/MERingue', build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
