Description: MERINGUE is a computational framework based on spatial auto-correlation and cross-correlation analysis to identify genes with spatially heterogeneous expression patterns, derive putative cell-cell communication, and perform spatially informed cell clustering in 2D and 3D in a density-agnostic manner using spatially resolved transcriptomics data.
